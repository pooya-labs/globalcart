# Data Sources, Translation and Provenance

## Current catalog source
**DummyJSON Products API:** https://dummyjson.com/products?limit=100

- Used as a public sample catalog to demonstrate automatic ingestion.
- Not Amazon inventory and not a commercial offer.
- The adapter normalizes records and keeps source identity/import time.
- Images are remote source-provided URLs and may change or fail.
- If the network source is unavailable, the UI uses a small local fixture.

## Amazon policy
Amazon is not connected. Do not scrape product pages or copy the catalog. A future integration is allowed only after verifying the account's eligibility and authorized API/program access and reviewing current terms for content reuse, image URLs, price refresh, attribution and linking. An affiliate API is not a wholesale inventory feed.

## Translation status
The code currently defines a provider interface and safe orchestration metadata. It does **not** yet automatically translate the full catalog. Until a provider adapter is configured, translated text is null and status is unavailable; source text must remain visible. A future scheduled job must translate title, description, category and attributes, preserve original fields, cache results, handle quotas/retries and record provider/locale/timestamp. API keys belong in GitHub Actions secrets and must never enter browser bundles or committed files.

## Foreign exchange
The storefront currently uses a user-configurable illustrative USD-to-Toman rate. It is not a live market quote. Future FX providers must return source, currency pair, timestamp and rate; stale values must be labelled.

## Provenance labels
- **External demo source:** a sample record returned by DummyJSON.
- **Local fallback:** fixture data included for offline resilience.
- **Translated:** only when a provider returns a non-empty translation.
- **Translation unavailable/error:** original text is retained.
- **Illustrative price:** converted using a manually configured sample rate.
- **Live external value:** only when its provider and timestamp are displayed.
